# Jay Looney's Resume

This is the source repository where I store a version of my resume as code.

## Progression

I started writing this in TeX /w LaTeX extensions in 2015 and since have graduated to writing it in JSONResume and finally FRESH.
LaTeX being a typesetting language is the most capable of the three but requires the most knowledge and tooling to use.
JSONResume by comparison is a dramatically simplified setup of a JSON blob with relevant resume sections.
FRESH is meant to be a standard schema for supporting Resume data and has a format available in JSON and YAML

I've used and experienced all three for a while and am trending towards FRESH because it's the most convenient to configure automated builds for.
